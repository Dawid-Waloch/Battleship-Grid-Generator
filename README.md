# üö¢ Battleship Grid Generator (C# Console App)
This is a simple console-based C# program that simulates automatic placement of ships on a Battleship game board. It generates a 10x10 grid and places ships of varying lengths (from 4-mast to 1-mast) while ensuring valid positions and surrounding restrictions according to classic Battleship rules.
# üéÆ Features
- Randomized ship placement on a 10x10 game board
- Ship types:
  - 1 √ó 4-mast ship
  - 2 √ó 3-mast ships
  - 3 √ó 2-mast ships
  - 4 √ó 1-mast ships
- Collision and boundary prevention
- Surrounding water (buffer) zones added to prevent adjacent ships
- Console output of the final board state:
  - 1 = ship
  - 2 = surrounding buffer (cannot place other ships here)
  - 0 = empty cell (visible as 0 in output)
 # üì¶ How It Works
- The board is initialized as a 12x12 array to simplify boundary checks.
- The program attempts to place ships of decreasing size in valid directions (up, down, left, right).
- Each ship is surrounded by 2s to mark restricted zones (no adjacent ships allowed).
- Final output prints the 10x10 visible game board with the ship layout.
# üöÄ How to Run
1. Make sure you have .NET SDK installed.
2. Save the code to a file named Program.cs.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
```bash
dotnet new console -n BattleshipApp
cd BattleshipApp
# Replace auto-generated Program.cs with your version
cp ../Program.cs .
dotnet run
```
